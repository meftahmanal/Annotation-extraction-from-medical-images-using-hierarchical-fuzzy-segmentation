# Extraction of Annotations in Medical Images - Method 2

## Overview
This section of the project addresses the extraction of annotations from medical images using a fuzzy hierarchical segmentation approach, with a specific focus on Method 2, which employs maximum entropy as the primary criterion for fuzziness.

## Methodology
Method 2 stands out for its use of maximum entropy as a criterion in fuzzy segmentation. This approach enhances the precision of segmenting complex biomedical images, such as brain scans, by efficiently handling the uncertainties and intricacies involved in the interpretation of such images.

### Key Concepts
- **Maximum Entropy**: Utilized to optimize the fuzziness criterion, ensuring a more accurate and reliable segmentation process.
- **Fuzzy Hierarchical Segmentation**: Allows for a nuanced analysis of medical images at multiple levels, enhancing the detection and extraction of annotations.

## Dataset
The method was applied to a specialized dataset comprising 26 brain scan images, incorporating a total of 80 annotations primarily in the form of arrows.

## Implementation and Results
- The implementation was carried out using Python, along with libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, and Scikit-Image.
- The results, evaluated based on precision and recall metrics, demonstrated the effectiveness of maximum entropy in improving the accuracy of annotation extraction in biomedical images.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Setup**: Ensure Python and required libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-Image) are installed.
2. **Running the Script**: Execute the main script of the project to initiate the extraction process.
3. **Analysis**: The script processes the images from the dataset and outputs the segmented annotations based on the defined maximum entropy criteria.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-Image

## Conclusion
Method 2, with its focus on maximum entropy in fuzzy hierarchical segmentation, has shown promising results in the complex task of extracting annotations from medical images. Its precision and reliability mark it as a significant contribution to the field of biomedical image analysis.
